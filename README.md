# Quick Update
OpenIFS has created its first image with the .ifs format even tho the image has messed up colors and is distorted it does somehow work ,the image will be added as a another file named '1stimage.ifs' in the zip 'OpenIFS1st.zip', and because i'm seeing progress of this format being better and better i'm probably going to be developing it as much as i can and because in poland its almost summer vacation i will be spending a lot of time making progress

# OpenIFS
OpenIFS is a FOSS image format which can be encrypted with a password or without one its not based on any other image format and its color palette is RGB, its a pretty advanced project of mine so its gonna be hard

# This Image Format and its Properties are still being developed
## Fixes to do/fixed
- conversion error 256 has been fixed even though it still is seen in the terminal the conversion works
- .ifs images are now smaller from idk 5MiB to 77kB so yeah i consider this a success but i still haven't tried making images with encryption

# TODO:
- Give the program a better GUI

# LIbraries to install
- PyQt5
- cryptography
- bz2
